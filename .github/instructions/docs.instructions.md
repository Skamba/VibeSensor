Docs
- Shared workflow/validation rules live in `.github/instructions/general.instructions.md`; this file only captures docs-specific deltas.
- Keep `docs/` short and focused. Add design changes (e.g. report layout) to `docs/design_language.md`.
- For any user-visible text changes, update `apps/server/data/report_i18n.json` and mention new keys in docs.
