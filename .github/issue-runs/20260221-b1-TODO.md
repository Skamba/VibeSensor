Round 1 of 10 issues
- [x] Issue #124 [TODO Import] TODO 4: No per-location sample-count normalization in `_sensor_intensity_by_location`
- [x] Issue #125 [TODO Import] TODO 5: Order-finding `matched_points` location label comes from per-sample `_location_label`, but "strongest_location" aggregation ignores multi-sensor corroboration
- [x] Issue #126 [TODO Import] TODO 6: `_location_speedbin_summary` picks best across ALL speed bins, not per-hypothesis
- [x] Issue #127 [TODO Import] TODO 7: `_most_likely_origin_summary` uses `top_causes[0]` with no spatial disambiguation
- [x] Issue #128 [TODO Import] TODO 8: Live diagnostics engine `_upsert_active_level` takes the highest-dB sensor without location awareness
- [x] Issue #129 [TODO Import] TODO 9: `_locations_connected_throughout_run` filter is defined but not used in location ranking
- [x] Issue #130 [TODO Import] TODO 10: `weak_spatial_separation` threshold is a hard-coded `1.2` with no justification or tuning
- [x] Issue #131 [TODO Import] TODO 1: Near-0 dB values occur by design when peak is barely above noise floor
- [x] Issue #133 [TODO Import] TODO 3: Report label `strength_text()` shows only dB, not raw amplitude
- [x] Issue #132 [TODO Import] TODO 2: Strength bands start at 10 dB — values 0–10 dB get no bucket (None)

Round 2 of 10 issues
- [ ] Issue #134 [TODO Import] TODO 4: `_top_strength_db()` in report_data.py recovers dB from findings but loses raw amplitude
- [ ] Issue #135 [TODO Import] TODO 5: `SensorFrame` does not persist raw peak amplitude or noise floor — lost at recording time
- [ ] Issue #136 [TODO Import] TODO 6: PDF peaks table shows `amp_g` column but it's the p95 FFT amplitude, not the strength amplitude
- [ ] Issue #137 [TODO Import] TODO 7: Observed Signature panel on PDF shows only label+dB with no amplitude context
- [ ] Issue #138 [TODO Import] TODO 8: UI dashboard displays only dB with no amplitude or scale explanation
- [ ] Issue #140 [TODO Import] TODO 1: Repeating transients at the same frequency are not reclassified as baseline noise
- [ ] Issue #141 [TODO Import] TODO 2: `select_top_causes` promotes transient-only findings when no order findings pass the confidence floor
- [ ] Issue #142 [TODO Import] TODO 3: No cross-sample noise floor tracking — per-sample P20 floor is independent
- [ ] Issue #143 [TODO Import] TODO 4: Live diagnostics `severity_from_peak` has no frequency-level transient tracking
- [ ] Issue #144 [TODO Import] TODO 5: Persistent peak findings confidence formula doesn't penalize non-localized signals

Round 3 of 10 issues
- [ ] Issue #145 [TODO Import] TODO 6: `_build_persistent_peak_findings` merges transient + persistent results indiscriminately
- [ ] Issue #146 [TODO Import] TODO 7: Duplicated peak classification logic between `findings.py` and `plot_data.py`
- [ ] Issue #148 [TODO Import] TODO 1: Fixed 10 km/h bins split real fault windows across bin boundaries
- [ ] Issue #147 [TODO Import] TODO 8: Spectrogram persistence weighting doesn't account for broadband noise elevation
- [ ] Issue #149 [TODO Import] TODO 2: Persistent peak findings report raw min-max speed range (too wide, uninformative)
- [ ] Issue #150 [TODO Import] TODO 3: Peak table `typical_speed_band` uses same raw min-max (inconsistent with order findings)
- [ ] Issue #151 [TODO Import] TODO 4: `_location_speedbin_summary` selects by max-of-mean without sample-count weighting
- [ ] Issue #152 [TODO Import] TODO 5: Two inconsistent speed-band formats confuse downstream consumers
- [ ] Issue #153 [TODO Import] TODO 6: Exact speed-amplitude windows available but discarded
- [ ] Issue #154 [TODO Import] TODO 7: `amp_vs_speed` plot data is always empty (key mismatch — adjacency finding)

Round 4 of 10 issues
- [ ] Issue #155 [TODO Import] TODO 7: Bug fix — amp_vs_speed plot always empty (quick fix, one line)
- [ ] Issue #156 [TODO Import] TODO 2: Most user-visible — persistent peak speed bands show full run range
- [ ] Issue #157 [TODO Import] TODO 1: Boundary-split causes misattribution for order findings
- [ ] Issue #158 [TODO Import] TODO 5: Inconsistent formats confuse the test plan / mechanic instructions
- [ ] Issue #159 [TODO Import] TODO 3: Peak table consistency
- [ ] Issue #160 [TODO Import] TODO 6: Expose rich data already available
- [ ] Issue #162 [TODO Import] TODO: Scenario-Based Regression Tests to Add
- [ ] Issue #161 [TODO Import] TODO 4: Mean-without-count weighting (subsumed by TODO 1 fix)
- [ ] Issue #172 [TODO Import] TODO 10: PDF Regression — Phased Run Content Validation

Round 5 of 10 issues

- [ ] Issue #176 [TODO Import] TODO 14: Test Plan Merging for Phased Scenarios
- [ ] Issue #178 [TODO Import] TODO 1: — No penalty for negligible absolute vibration strength
- [ ] Issue #177 [TODO Import] TODO 15: `_location_speedbin_summary()` for Multi-Location Phased Data
- [ ] Issue #179 [TODO Import] TODO 2: — No penalty for weak spatial separation
- [ ] Issue #180 [TODO Import] TODO 3: — Unconditional base of 0.20 inflates minimum confidence too high
- [ ] Issue #182 [TODO Import] TODO 5: — Steady-speed penalty (×0.88) is too gentle
- [ ] Issue #181 [TODO Import] TODO 4: — SNR weight is only 10% — strength is vastly under-weighted
- [ ] Issue #183 [TODO Import] TODO 6: — Persistent-peak findings have no absolute strength gate
