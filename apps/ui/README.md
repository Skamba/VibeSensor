# Web UI

Single-page TypeScript application that provides real-time vibration monitoring,
sensor management, run history, and car configuration. Communicates with the Pi
server over HTTP (REST) and WebSocket (live data).

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — application logic
- **Vite** — build tool and dev server
- **uPlot** — high-performance spectrum charts
- **Playwright** — visual regression testing
- **CSS custom properties** — Material Design 3 inspired theming

## Setup

```bash
cd apps/ui
npm ci
npm run dev          # Dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # Production build to dist/
npm run typecheck    # Type check without emitting
```

The built output in `dist/` is copied to `apps/server/public/` for serving by FastAPI.
Use `python tools/sync_ui_to_pi_public.py` from the repo root to build and sync
in one step.

## Source Modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.ts` | Core application logic, DOM bindings, view management |
| `api.ts` | REST API client with typed request/response interfaces |
| `ws.ts` | WebSocket client with auto-reconnect and stale detection |
| `i18n.ts` | Internationalization dictionary (English, Dutch) |
| `spectrum.ts` | uPlot chart wrapper for interactive spectrum visualization |
| `server_payload.ts` | TypeScript type definitions for server messages |
| `diagnostics.ts` | Strength band normalization and vibration matrix helpers |
| `vehicle_math.ts` | Tire diameter, order tolerance, and uncertainty calculations |
| `format.ts` | Number, byte, and timestamp formatting utilities |
| `constants.ts` | Sensor location codes and vibration source columns |
| `theme.ts` | Chart color palette and order band fill colors |
| `styles/app.css` | Full CSS with light/dark theme tokens |

## Features

- **Live view** — multi-sensor spectrum chart and recording controls
- **History view** — recorded runs with insights, PDF download, ZIP export (CSV raw samples + JSON run details)
- **Settings view** — car profiles (tire/drivetrain wizard with car library), analysis parameters, speed source, sensor naming and location mapping
- **Auto theme** — follows system light/dark preference
- **Drive sizing** — larger touch targets on tablet viewports
- **Demo mode** — deterministic UI state via `?demo=1` for testing

## Visual Tests

Playwright snapshot tests capture the UI across 4 viewports:

| Viewport | Theme |
|----------|-------|
| Laptop (1280x800) | Light |
| Laptop (1280x800) | Dark |
| Tablet (768x1024) | Light |
| Tablet (768x1024) | Dark |

```bash
npx playwright install chromium   # first time only
npm run test:visual               # compare against baselines
npm run test:visual:update        # regenerate after intentional changes
```

Baselines live in `tests/snapshots/`. Tests use demo mode for deterministic payloads.

## Design Language

The UI follows the design system documented in
[docs/design_language.md](../../docs/design_language.md) — purple accent, minimal
flat aesthetic, token-driven styling.
